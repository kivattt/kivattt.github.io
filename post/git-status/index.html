	<p>
	If your choice of version control is Git, you likely use <span class="snippet">git status</span> every day.
	</p>

	<p>
	You might even have a short shell alias like <span class="snippet">gs</span>, or use an IDE with colorful filenames showing you which files have been changed without ever manually typing the command.
	</p>

	<p>
	In this article, I will explain the details of how <span class="snippet">git status</span> works.
	</p>

	<p>
	When you first clone a repository, <span class="snippet">git status</span> will tell you "nothing to commit, working tree clean".
	<br>
	<img src="cloned_repository.png"></img>
	<br>
	The "working tree" is all the files in your local repository, and since you haven't made any changes yet, it is clean. Boring!
	</p>

	<p>
	Let's add a new file called <span class="snippet">new-file.txt</span>
	<img src="new_file.png" style="width: 100%"></img>
	<br>
	So, how does Git know we just created a file?
	</p>

	<p>
	Well, when we cloned this repository, Git created a flat list of all the filenames and put it inside a file called <span class="snippet">.git/index</span>.

	<br>
	Now that we've created a new file, this list is out of sync with the working tree!

	<br>
	<br>
	<span class="note">From here on, I will refer to the <span class="snippet">.git/index</span> file as "the Git index".</span>

	<br>
	<br>
	When a file is not in the Git index, it is "untracked", as git status just told us.
	<br>
	To track this file, Git tells us to use "git add"
	<img src="staged_file.png" style="width: 100%"></img>
	<br>
	Viola! Our file is tracked. It is now in the Git index, which we can check with the <span class="snippet">git ls-files --stage new-file.txt</span> command.
	</p>

	<p>
	Looking closely at the output, we can tell there's some additional metadata stored about each file in the Git index.
	<br>
	<br>
	The first 3 digits in <span class="snippet">100644</span> is the octal representation of the 4-bit "object type", with <span class="snippet">100</span> (octal) signifying a regular file.
	<br>
	These 3 octal digits actually contain 7 bits of data, with the lower 3 bits currently unused. Here's some Python showing the 4-bit "object type" from these three octal digits. <span class="snippet">bin(0o100 >> 3) == '0b1000'</span>
	<br>
	<br>
	The next 3 digits <span class="snippet">644</span> are the octal unix permission bits of this file. Regular files like this can only have 2 possible values here, 755 or 644.
	<br>
	<br>
	It also stores a SHA-1 hash, more on that later.
	</p>
	<p>

	<h2>Implementation</h2>
	Here's the metadata I need in my implementation of <span class="snippet">git status</span>.
	</p>
	<p>
	<img src="git_index_entry.png" style="width: 100%"></img>
	<br>
	The filename is not shown in this struct, since it is stored in a map key.
	</p>

	<h2>Unfinished</h2>
	This article is unfinished.
	<br>
	While writing this article, I discovered 3 bugs.
	<br>
	2 bugs in <a href="https://github.com/kivattt/fen">fen</a>.
	<br>
	1 bug in <a href="https://github.com/kivattt/gogitstatus">gogitstatus</a>.
	<br>
	I have yet to fix 1 of these bugs, and haven't been able to finish the implementation section of this article.
	<br>
	I wrote down some things I wanted to include in this article, but didn't get around to.
	<br>
	Have these notes, as a treat.

	<p>

	<h2>The gogitstatus library</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Silly incremental path name reading implemented before knowing of 12-bit size header turning out to be useful</li>
		<li>The unique way objects are hashed (null-byte thing)</li>
		<li>Optimization</li>
		<li>gitignore library being the bottleneck (regex...)</li>
		<li>Testing (having to zip repositories)</li>
		<li>Windows backslash path challenges</li>
	</ul>

	<h2>Integrating into fen</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Unexpected new requirements (context cancellation, map lookup)</li>
		<li>Concurrency (and when to re-run git status)</li>
		<li>Testing on large repositories (chromium, linux, kubernetes) requiring adding a "running git status..." status message</li>
		<li>A note on kernel filesystem caching</li>
		<li>Limiting the number of stored repository changes</li>
		<li>Optimizing the color lookup</li>
		<li>Updating on Git commands by watching for .git/index file changes</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
